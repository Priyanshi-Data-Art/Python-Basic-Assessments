    "\n",
    "Here is the main feature that make python is popular languge.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Simplicity and Readibilty:\n",
    "As we all know that syntax of python is simpler then other programming language, so it is easy to learn for developer. Also python supports \n",
    "indentation to define block of code, which increase readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Powerful Libraries:\n",
    "The main power of python is thier extensive libraries. Even, Python is ideal choice for data science and data analytics because \n",
    "of their strong libraries such as numpy, pandas, tensor flow, Matplotlib, PyTorch etc. These tools is best for visualisation and building \n",
    "AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Beginer Friendly:\n",
    "The syntax of python is simple and easy to understand so beacuse of this most of the developer start their coding journey from python. \n",
    "So, we can say python is beginer friendly as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Verstilty: \n",
    "Python is the programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms (including procedureal, object oriented, functional \n",
    "programming). It makes python suitable for wide range of application.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Cross-platform:\n",
    "Python run on various platform such as linux, windows, macOS etc. Because of this developers can write code once and run it anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Performance and robust framework:\n",
    "Python offers strong framework that support web developement such as django, flask although, the perfomance of python is also very high.'''\n"
